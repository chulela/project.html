    <h1>Muichiro Tokito: Mist Hashira</h1>
    <p>Muichiro Tokito (時とき透とう 無む一いち郎ろう Tokitō Muichirō?) is a major supporting character of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He is a Demon Slayer of the Demon Slayer Corps and the current Mist Hashira (霞かすみ柱ばしら Kasumi Bashira?).</p>
    <p>Muichiro Tokito (時透 無一郎 Tokito Muichiro) is part of the Demon Slayer Corps in the Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer) series. He is a genius and only took 2 months before becoming a Pillar at a young age and he uses the Breath of Mist (霞の呼吸 Kasumi no Kokyu). He has long black hair which fades into turquoise and pale green eyes. His eyes always look blank and most of the time he doesn’t show emotion and is expressionless. His Demon Slayer uniform has wide loose sleeves unlike the cuffed gakuran look and doesn't wrap his calves giving off a kimono style.</p>

    <p>Birthdate: </p>
    <p>Birthplace: </p>
    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Muichiro is a young boy of fair skin and short stature with a lean muscular build along with long, straight hair of a raven-black color that fades to a cyan color as it approaches his waist. He wears his hair loose with two clumps protruding slightly from each side of his head, a set of marginally shorter hair left down to frame his face, and unruly bangs over his forehead. He also possesses large, empty-looking cyan eyes. He is identical in appearance to his older twin brother Yuichiro.</p>
    <p>Muichiro wears a black standard Demon Slayer uniform, tinted bluish black in the anime, consisting of a button-up jacket with a stand collar. However, he wears longer, looser sleeves that are more reminiscent of those of a kimono than of the standard uniform shirt-like cuff sleeves. Along with this, in the place of the standard tattsuke hakama wrapped by a pair of white kyahan around his calves, he wears his hakama in the umanori style, that along his style of sleeves, gives a loose and oversized appearance to his whole garment. He also has dark blue tabi socks and a pair of white zōri with dark blue straps.</p>
    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Muichiro seems to always be forgetting things and his mind is constantly wandering. He doesn't let his emotions control him and his actions are decided based on logic. However, before his twin brother died he had a much more caring personality, showing compassion and kindness. When his brother is killed by a Demon Muichiro loses his memories and becomes passive. After his memories returned he started to express his feelings more allowing himself to display more emotions.</p>
