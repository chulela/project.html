    <p>Mitsuri Kanroji (甘露寺蜜璃 Kanroji Mitsuri) is part of the Demon Slayer Corps and is the Love Pillar. She uses the Breath of Love (恋の呼吸 Koi no Kokyu) which is derived from the Breath of Flames (炎の呼吸 Hono no Kokyu) and her instructor was Shinjuro Rengoku the former Flame Pillar. Mitsuri is a voluptuous young woman with a kind face. She has pale green eyes with small moles under each eye. Her most defining feature would be her long hair usually tied in three braids which is pink and fades into neon green halfway through. It is said that her hair turned this color due to her eating too many sakuramochi. She wears a modified version of the Demon Slayer outfit in which her chest area is left unbuttoned and instead of the hakama she wears a short pleated skirt and over the top of her uniform she wears a white haori. Also, a very similar color to her neon green hair she wears striped thigh high socks which were a gift from Obanai Iguro.</p>

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>Mitsuri is an emotional and passionate girl who compliments people in her head constantly, most likely a contributing factor towards her nickname "The Hashira of Love", although she is rather shy and easily flustered. She is always kind to others, most notably towards Obanai Iguro, whom she has an especially strong bond with. She greatly admires her fellow Hashira brethren and respects them, particularly her mentor, Rengoku, who she sees as her big brother figure.</p>
    <p>Mitsuri's loving kindness and compassion extends to Tanjiro and Nezuko Kamado, with Mitsuri being incredibly touched by Tanjiro's protective nature towards his younger sister. Because of this, she was one of the only Hashira (alongside Giyu) willing to accept Nezuko into the corps, despite her being a demon. In the Swordsmith Village Arc, she quickly formed a bond with the Kamado siblings, particularly towards Nezuko, acting like a big sister figure.</p>
