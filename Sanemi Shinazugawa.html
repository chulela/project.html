    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Sanemi is a tall man of very muscular build, with spiky long white hair and large almond-shaped eyes with purple irises. His face and body are covered with scars, accrued over his many years of fighting demons. He cuts his hair short somewhere in between the events of the Hashira meeting and the Mugen Train incidnet. He is usually seen wearing a crazed expression on his face.</p>
    <p>He wears a black standard Demon Slayer uniform, tinted dark green in the anime, unbuttoned to expose his chest and abs with a white long sleeved haori over it with the kanji for kill (殺さつ satsu?) etched on the back, white buckles around his shins and tabi socks with a pair of white zōri with green straps.</p>
    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Sanemi is very hot blooded, short tempered, and stubborn. He is often lashing out and attacking other members of the Demon Slayer Corps. The only person he shows respect to and speaks respectfully to is Kagaya Ubuyashiki the 97th leader of the Demon Slayer Corps only after realising the man was much more than what his sickly appearance seemed. Sanemi's cold and rude behavior is due to him losing his family he deeply cared about in the past. When his brother Genya Shinazugawa joins the Demon Slayer Corps he insults and verbally abuses him and tries to force Genya Shinazugawa to quit the organisation so he wouldn't be in any danger. He had wanted his brother he loved so much to live a happy life with a wife and many children without worrying about Demons.</p>
