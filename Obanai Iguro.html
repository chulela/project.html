    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Obanai is a young man of short stature, pale skin complexion, and a fairly muscular build. He has straight-edged raven-black hair of varying lengths, the longest reaching down to his shoulders and the shortest stopping at his cheekbones, which he wears down with two shorter strands hanging between his eyes. His eyes are almond-shaped and tilt upwards on the far sides, and are unique colored due to Obanai possessing heterochromia—his right eye is yellow and his left eye is teal. He is partially blind, barely able to see out of his right eye.</p>
    <p>Obanai's mouth is usually hidden by the bandage he wears over his lower face to hide his large facial scars, which were the result of his family horrifically cutting open his mouth to resemble that of a snake's gape.</p>
    <p>He wears a black standard Demon Slayer uniform, tinted deep koamaru in the anime, along with a black and white striped haori, the hem and cuffs of which are striped length ways rather than vertically, which covers his hands. Obanai also sports bandages as his leg-wraps around his calves giving the resemblance of more classic kyahan, as well as another set of bandages that cover his mouth, and white with blue-strapped zōri on his feet. He is also always seen with his white snake, Kaburamaru, wrapped around his shoulders.</p>
    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Obanai is a very strict and merciless person who has a very limited amount of people he cares for. During Pillar training he ties up the lower ranked Demon slayers for petty reasons such as annoying him and uses them as obstacles.</p>
    <p>He respects Kagaya Ubuyashiki, the 97th leader of the Demon Slayer Corps by bowing down to him when he appeared for a meeting. He also respects Gyomei Himejima stating he couldn't even be Himejima's shield. He cares greatly for and has a crush on Mitsuri Kanroji, even gifting her green striped socks to wear as a present but because he possess an immense sense of self loathing he doesn’t confess his feelings. This self loathing comes from the fact that he was born into a selfish clan who would mercilessly sacrifice their own children to a Demon for riches. Obanai thinks of himself and his family to be so tainted that, only by defeating Muzan and dying would it hope to cleanse his corrupted blood. Only by first dying then reincarnating into a world without Demons would he be worthy of confessing his feelings to Mitsuri Kanroji.</p>
