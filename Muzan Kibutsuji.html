    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Muzan's physical appearance is of a young man with curly black hair and bright orange eyes, in his late twenties. He has pale skin on his face, and has distinct long blue nails. His wardrobe includes a white fedora with a bow, and an elaborate matching suit. Even if he prefers this form, he will change his appearance to hide from Slayers of the Demons. One is a beautiful woman with pale skin, a long black kimono with intricate patterns. His disguises are so effective that he can not be recognized even by his allies.</p>
    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>As the king of demons, Muzan is a callous, cold-hearted, ruthless, intimidating, tyrannical, heartless, egotistical, and extremely narcissistic perfectionist with a horrendous self-absorbed streak. He never tolerates anyone who mocks him, even to the point of brutally murdering a pair of drunk bystanders who were simply rude to him along with their female companion, while proclaiming his own delusional grandeur. Like most narcissists, his ego is also very fragile and tends to have a short temper fuse for the pettiest reasons, and as a result, he is prone to losing his cool whenever someone insults him or even mildly disagrees with him, as displayed when he savagely murdered Rokuro for "ordering him around" when all the latter did was desperately ask him for more blood.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>During the Heian era he was conceived as a human male, there's a description of a nobleman who lived in a palace. He had a congenital disability, struggling to survive even a little, and was told by a doctor at the time that he would die by the time he turned 20. There was a physician who prescribed a new drug that was still in development, hoping it would cure his condition. Instead of getting better, his body got progressively weaker, so he aimed at murdering the "doctor" with a knife to the head from behind.</p>
    <p>Ironically however, the drug's effects began to take hold soon afterwards, and the awful disease began to improve. At the same time, though, he couldn't go anywhere in the sunlight, and had a taste for human flesh. It is that the "human eating demon was created at this moment The cannibal instinct didn't matter to him, but, because it was so painful to restrict daytime activities, he tested the composition of the medication blue amaryllis cluster given by the doctor to himself so he wouldn't perish even under the sun, he found out that the blue amaryllis cluster was rarely used and began to hunt for it. But even if he had been looking all over Japan for more than 1000 years, let alone the habitat and method of agriculture, he did not know if it really existed or if it was just a metaphor. He has given top priority to seeking out the blue amaryllis cluster and to developing those who can withstand sunlight in order to overcome sunlight.</p>
