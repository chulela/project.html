    <h1>Kanae Kocho: Former Flower Hashira</h1>
    <p>Kanae Kocho (胡こ蝶ちょう カナエ Kochō Kanae?) was a minor character in Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. She was a Demon Slayer and the late Flower Hashira (花はな柱ばしら Hana Bashira?). She is the older sister of Shinobu Kocho and the adoptive older sister of Kanao Tsuyuri.</p>
    <p>She was slain several years prior to the present story by Upper Rank Two, Doma.</p>
    <P>"Once you decide to defeat a demon, defeat it. Once you decide to win, win. Win, whatever the cost. You made that promise with Kanao and me, didn't you?" - Kanae Kocho</P>
    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Name: Kocho Kanae</p>
    <p>Age: 17</p>
    <p>Gender: Female</p>
    <p>Birthdate: </p>
    <p>Birthplace:</p>
    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Kanae was a slender-built girl much like her younger sister, who was very tall for her age and, contrary to her pale complexion, had distinctly red lips. She had very-dark grey thick, straight hair that reached below her waist, worn down over her shoulders with two short clumps and bangs with arched ear-length on either side of her nose. Her eyes are pale-violet and slanting, shiny and bug-like to the sides of her nose with several prominent white sparkles reflecting light off them.</p>
    <p>She wears a purple-tinted version of the traditional Demon Slayer Corps uniform, as well as a piece of fabric all over her calves and pale strapped sandals. She sported a pair of green-pink butterfly hairpins, which she wore painted on either side of her head and it was later used as a memento by her adoptive younger sister, Kanao Tsuyuri. She was also wearing a a white, light green and pink butterfly-patterned haori, which Shinobu Kocho currently wears following Kanae's death.</p>
    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Kanae was the polar opposite of her biological younger sister Shinobu Kocho; she was a sweet, patient and kind girl with an easy-going personality, which is seen in the soft smile she almost always has on her face in the flashbacks of Shinobu and Kanao Tsuyuri. She was always kind-hearted and friendly towards others, even to the demons that she has faced and killed.</p>
    <p>As Sanemi Shinazugawa chuckled at her leader Kagaya Ubuyashiki, she showed compassion for him and politely told Sanemi about how Kagaya is really caring for the Demon Slayers under his command. She also had a vision of being able to live alongside the Demons peacefully one day amid all the pain and death they caused on humans, which encouraged Shinobu to likewise strive to do. Tragically after Kanae's violent death, Shinobu abandons that effort and walked down a vengeful path which ultimately proved to be self-destructive, although after seeing similarity between Tanjiro and Kanae, she was willing to give Kanae's vision another chance.</p>
