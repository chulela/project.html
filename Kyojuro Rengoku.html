    <h1>Kyojuro Rengoku: Flame Hashira</h1>
    <p>Kyojuro Rengoku (煉れん獄ごく 杏きょう寿じゅ郎ろう Rengoku Kyōjurō?) was a major supporting character of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba and a major character in the Mugen Train Arc. He was a Demon Slayer of the Demon Slayer Corps and the late Flame Hashira (炎えん柱ばしら En Bashira?).</p>
    <p>Kyojuro Rengoku (煉獄 杏寿郎 Rengoku Kyojuro) is part of the Demon Slayer Corps and is the Flame Pillar in the Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer) series. He is also the first Pillar to die, getting killed by Upper Moon Three, Akaza. He uses the Breath of Flames (炎の呼吸 Hono no Kokyu) the same as his father, Shinjuro Rengoku who was the former Flame Pillar. Kyojuro has messy yellow hair with red tips that comes just below his shoulders. His eyes also similar in color are yellow with red irises. He wears the standard black Demon Slayer uniform as well as a white haori with yellow and red flame like patterns along the bottom. He is always seen wearing a serious or an excitable expression. Kyojurou takes his duties responsibly and doesn’t seem to be a character to dwell on any negative feelings.</p>
    <p>“There’s no need for a trial here! Protecting demons is clearly a violation of conduct. We can deal with it ourselves! We’ll decapitate every demon!” - Kyojuro</p>
    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Name: Rengoku Kyojuro</p>
    <p>Age: 20</p>
    <p>Gender: Male</p>
    <p>Birthdate: May 10</p>
    <p>Birthplace:</p>
    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Kyojuro was a young adult of tall stature and lean-muscular build. He had long bright yellow hair with red streaks akin to flames along with two shoulder-length bangs and two chin-length bangs on the side of his head, black forked eyebrows, and golden eyes that fade to red with white pupils. He was known to be charismatic and had an air of great optimism, having an enthusiastic smile plastered on his face nearly all the time.</p>
    <p>Kyojuro wore the standard black Demon Slayer uniform, tinted brown in the anime, which consisted of a brown button-up jacket with stand collar and long sleeeves, a white belt around his waist and tattsuke-hakama pants. Over this, he wore a haori with a white-yellow gradient pattern and red flame-like ridges at the end that his father Shinjuro had once worn and more than likely his father had worn when they were the Flame Hashira respectively. Finally, he wore red kyahan with yellow flames erupting from the bottom-up, with pale brown tabi socks and a pair of white zōri with red straps.</p>
    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Kyojuro is very enthusiastic towards his duties as a Demon Slayer and takes his responsibilities as a Pillar very seriously. During the fight in the train against Lower Moon One, Enmu he was very disappointed in himself due to the fact he didn’t wake up earlier than Tanjiro Kamado who wasn’t a Pillar. He has a strong sense of justice and has a strict sense of right and wrong believing Tanjiro to be in the wrong for protecting a Demon regardless of the fact that Nezuko was his younger sister. Kyojuro always tries to stay positive and wasn’t disheartened and stayed cheerful even when his father demeaned him stating it was pointless when he became a Pillar. Kyojuro believes that the strong have a duty to protect the weak and uses his strength and knowledge to protect and nurture helpless people and fellow Demon Slayers. His mother taught Kyojuro the importance of life and instilled strong moral values and principles into him.</p>
