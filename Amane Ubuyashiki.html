    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Name: Ubuyashiki Amane</p>
    <p>Age: 27</p>
    <p>Gender: Female</p>
    <p>Birthdate: </p>
    <p>Birthplace:</p>
    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Amane is a woman of average height and pale skin complexion. She possesses large, plum purple eyes and short eyebrows, a trait seen in her children. She wears her white hair down and swept to both the left and right at the front and in a short ponytail in the back, with two strands of hair loose at the side of her head. Her beauty is apparent as Muichiro Tokito once described her as appearing like a forest spirit when they first met, and Mitsuri Kanroji, being asked to speak by Amane, took the chance to admire her beauty.</p>
    <p>Amane wears a salmon-colored kimono with an ombre to orange at the top with flower patterns with a dark-indigo haori with numerous blue butterfly-patterns. She also wore a brown with a paler shade striped-obi with an orange obiage supporting it.</p>
    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Amane is shown to possess the same quiet, strict and serious disposition as her husband and children, acting professionally and tactfully when communicating with the Hashira during her time filling in for husband when his health began to fail. She is shown to be just as devoted to the Demon Slayer Corps as her husband and children as well, and spared no time in trying to figure out anything that could be used to turn the tide of battle in to their favor.</p>
    <p>As well as this, Amane has been shown to truly love and care for her husband, Kagaya Ubuyashiki, and is seen constantly nursing him and staying by his side as his body slowly began to fail and his health further worsened. In fact, the only time Amane dropped her usual controlled demeanor was when Kagaya's health began to severely plummet and he began to cough out blood, causing her to immediately panic and worry as she barked out orders for her children to help her treat him, showing a genuine sense of love between them. During a moment alone with him, Kagaya held her hand and thanked her for everything she has done, causing her to quietly cry and return his sentiment.</p>
    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Leadership Skills: When her husband's health begins to fail, Amane shows herself to be a highly competent leader and military commander, having been able to fill in for her husband in his duties as Corps Commander for the Demon Slayer Corps during the final days of his life. This is seen when Amane possesses the necessary skills to direct and lead the Hashira themselves despite their extreme personalities and dispositions.</p>
