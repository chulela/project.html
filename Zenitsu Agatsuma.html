    <hr>
    <p>His hairstyle is a bowl shaped of varying lengths of clumps of hair, tapering off at the ends. Initially black, after being struck by lightning, his hair took on a yellow hue which faded to dark orange at the ends. Zenitsu's eyes are sloping downward and irises beginning from brown hue to gold. He sports a pale brown variant of the traditional Demon Slayer outfit consisting of a dark brown gakuran shirt, a white belt around his waist and stretching hakama trousers, as well as a patterned, yellow and orange gradient haori with his trademark mini-triangle. Besides that, Zenitsu also wears a pair of tabi boots, wrapped in 3 white bows at the front, with the same pattern as his haori, and silver-laced zori sandals.</p>
    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Claiming he doesn’t have long to live because of how dangerous a job being a demon slayer is. After completing the final selection, his first remarks were made in a pessimistic manner. Given his ability, he also has very low self-esteem, to the extent where he feels he's essentially useless, as seen when he couldn't imagine he'd kill a Demon he had, tricking himself into thinking instead that it was Shoichi, even though the latter was a young child who had no remarkable Demon-slaying capacity whatsoever. Zenitsu is in a constant state of anxiety and paranoia, always crying and tries to run away from the sight of risk. He is saying that he wants to live a humble, normal life instead of that of a Demon Slayer in which he believes he's worthless all along.</p>
    <p>Despite his weaknesses, Zenitsu has a drive to meet the expectations of others and dreams to have the strength to protect everyone he cares about. A surprising trait Zenitsu possesses is that he is forward when it comes to women, and tells girls to marry him when they show the least amount of compassion. Going so far as to willingly place himself in danger in order to protect or show off to the opposite gender, changing his usual pessimistic outlook towards life in general. When offered the basic goal of protecting people, he displays dedication, explicitly shown to put himself in danger of protecting Nezuko Kamado showing how much he cares about her. Shows high respect towards his deceased teacher, Jigoro Kuwajima which helps him overcome obstacles when he is in need.</p>
