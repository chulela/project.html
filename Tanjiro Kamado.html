    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Tanjiro is a young boy of average height with fairly tanned skin and an athletic, muscular physique. He has ruffled, black hair with burgundy tips, combed back to expose his forehead, and wide, dark red eyes with white pupils that appear lighter around the lower section of his irises. He also has a scar on the top left of his forehead, first seen when his mother brought him to watch his father perform the Hinokami Kagura dance.</p>
    <p>The scar originally looked somewhat like a graze until his fight with the Hand Demon during the Final Selection, after which it develops into a flame-like pattern as his Demon Slayer Mark. It is noted that his hands are visibly rougher for someone his age, as a result of his rigorous training under Sakonji Urokodaki. Tanjiro looks remarkably similar in appearance to his ancestor Sumiyoshi, possessing the same facial structure, eyes, and hairstyle as him, although Sumiyoshi's hair was longer, about shoulder-length and would be tied in a ponytail behind his head.</p>
    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Tanjiro shows traits such as virtue, generosity, honesty, and humbleness. He is gentle to a fault, preventing him from making decisive decisions but is later shown to be serious when he needs to be. In the face of danger, he is brave enough to fight a demon slayer unarmed. Honest sense of righteousness, his demeanor can be interpreted as stubbornness when dealing with others. He is never afraid to ask others for help, and just as willing to return the favor. Tanjiro shows a natural talent for observation, able to discern situations quickly, often using his heightened sense of smell.</p>
    <p>He is caring and protective of his friends, especially when it comes to his sister Nezuko. Out of all his traits, the one that sets him apart from others is his capacity for empathy, even towards human eating demons. Often followed by retaliation during battle, he hesitates with indecision before finishing his foes. However, he exhibits unfaltering conviction to protect Nezuko at all costs and does not hesitate when it comes to his sister.</p>
