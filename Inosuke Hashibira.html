    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <hr>
    <P>Inosuke is a young man of average height and pale complexion with an extremely toned and muscular build for his age, possessing large, defined muscles most notably over his stomach and arms. In sharp contrast to this, he has an incredibly pretty and feminine face with large, wide eyes that are framed by an array of long eyelashes, their irises a dark to soft pale green, thin eyebrows and what could be a small, well-mannered mouth. His thick, black hair reaches just past his shoulders, fading into blue at the tips and forming an unruly and uneven fringe that falls just above his eyes, puffing out before curving and thinning towards his forehead.</P>
    <p>Inosuke wears his altered version of the standard Demon Slayer uniform, which consists only of the baggy hakama pants, his tinted a dark gray-blue, which he fastens around his hips with a thick belt of fluffy brown animal fur. The usual cloth leg-wraps are replaced with what appear to be knee-high socks of furry hide which expose his heels and toes, which also appear to be what fastens the sandal-bases he wears on his feet. His most defining feature is the gray, hollowed-out boar's head he wears as to mask his own, the eyes of which he has tampered with to allow himself vision while wearing it which has been revealed to have belonged to his late adoptive boar mother.</p>
    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Inosuke is a proud and short-tempered young man.

[Giyu Tomioka]/otapedia/anime/kimetsu_no_yaiba_demon_slayer/giyu_tomioka) the water pillar has to literally tie him up after the fight with the Father Spider Demon, to prevent him from challenging him.</p>
    <p>This abrasive personality of his gradually changes the more he spends time with his companions, becoming influenced by Tanjiro’s kindness and generosity. Developing a sense of friendship towards Zenitsu, Tanjiro and acknowledging the strength of others. Inosuke is influenced more and more, learning to strategize when engaging in combat and using smart tactics he has learned from more experienced Demon Slayers.</p>
