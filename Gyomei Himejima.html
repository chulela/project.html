    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Gyomei is a hulking figure among the Demon Slayers. He is one of the tallest characters in the series, easily towering over his fellow Hashira. He is powerfully built and extremely muscular. He has spiky black hair and a prominent scar running horizontally across his forehead. Having been blind since childhood, he has white eyes with no visible irises or pupils. His eyes frequently tear-up when he gets emotional.</p>
    <p>Gyomei wears a black and white uniform typical of a Demon Slayer, with bandages over his shins resembling kyahan and white zōri with an olive green happi draped over his shoulders. The collared frame of the happi contains the kanji for the Japanese Nianfo/Shin Buddha chant (南な無む阿あ弥み陀だ仏ぶつ Namu Amida Butsu?) from the top-down, along with the separate kanji all over at the back. He also sports a large-beaded necklace around his neck and carries a set of ojuzu beads when he is not engaged in battle.</p>
    <p>He sustains a scar across his forehead after being slashed by a crescent moon blade from Kokushibo. His left leg from the knee below was later severed during the battle against Muzan.</p>
    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Gyomei is very religious, often seen offering prayers to people and situations which sadden him. He is gentle and highly emotional, frequently tearing up in all sorts of situations. Despite him being kind and emotional he is very objective and doubtful of people especially children, thinking of them as pure, naive, weak, and completely fine with cruelty. However, once he accepts someone, no matter what others will say he will not doubt them. This is seen when he fully accepts Tanjiro Kamado and his sister, Nezuko who he thought was better executed.</p>
